[inputs]
;input pins to which the control components are connected

;whether to invert the logic of the button pins (including scene input line);
;Set to True if the buttons are connected to the 3.3V source. The pins will be
;configured to use internal pull-down resistors, and high voltage will be
;interpreted as a button press.  Set to False if the buttons are connected to
;ground. The pins will be configured to use internal pull-down resistors, and
;low voltage will be interpreted as a button press.

;lcd-related setting

;pins for the LCD's LED backlights
pin_red: 10
pin_green: 9
pin_blue: 11

;;colors for different states, expressed as 3-bit bitmasks to turn on the
;;different backlight LEDs. Bit 2 (most-significant) is red, bit 1 is green, bit
;;0 is blue.

;color when scene button is down (e.g. being tapped)
;6 = 0b110 = yellow
color_scene_tap: 6

;color when playing
;2 = 0b010 = green
color_playing: 2

;color when stopped in manual mode (not accepting scene button input)
;1 = 0b001 = blue
color_stop_manu: 1

;color when stopped in automatic mode (accepting scene button input)
;3 = 0b011 = green + blue = teal
color_stop_auto: 3

;color for errors with sound playback.  If in manual mode, this is when the
;scene button keeps getting pressed and the controller (the person in the sound
;trailer) has failed to hit play. If in automatic mode, this is wen the scene
;button keeps getting pressed after playing has started for a bit.
;4 = 0b100 = red

;something is wrong and start showing the error color on the LCD
