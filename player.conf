;input pins to which the control components are connected

;whether to invert the logic of the button pins (including scene input line);
;Set to True if the buttons are connected to the 3.3V source. The pins will be
;configured to use internal pull-down resistors, and high voltage will be
;interpreted as a button press.  Set to False if the buttons are connected to
;ground. The pins will be configured to use internal pull-down resistors, and
;low voltage will be interpreted as a button press.
